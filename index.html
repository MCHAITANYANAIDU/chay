<p> A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.
    [1] Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also
    offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings,
    including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food
     restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.</p>
